<h2>What does Cybersecurity do? </h2>
<p>
Cybercrime is a form of warfare used through the cyber world that attack system hardware, software, and networks. The role in cybersecurity is to understand how the IT components of a company are designed with frequent concentration toward detail, and the continuous observation and assessments of any threats that violate a company’s network. The main function of cybersecurity is to maintain and discover various approaches on defending and fortifying crucial data, using various means such as,</p><ol>
<li>	Using password defence applications, anti-virus platforms and exposure control software’s.
<li>	Reporting on current events within a network and analyse its strong points, with an ability to review the report in detail, that gives an overview of how effective the data defences are and identify any strange activity in the network.
<li>	Identifying any weak points in the network, by continuously examining the network before any bad actors or outside threats that try to concede it.
Reference for entire paragraph: (W.G.U, n.d.)</ol>
<h2>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h2>
<p>There are several high-quality bits of technology that play an important role in cyber crime prevention, they not only include physical technology but can also include software updates and policies that can be implemented to improve the privacy and protection of personal information and not impede on any governing laws within a particular country. Some of these technologies include Two-Factor Authentication, behaviour analytics, pin and/or password protection and blockchain cybersecurity (I.F.F, 2019).</p>
<h2>What can be done now? </h2><p> <ul>
Although there is a lack of awareness around the world about how serious cybercrime is, there are many things that can be done today to help you to protect your important data from being in the wrong hands, this includes,
<li>Designing effective policies and methods for workers and companies
<li>	Setting up a security system to guard information and networks
<li>Confirming purchasing requests prior to operations
<li>	Designing a system that can identify fake emails
<li>Cybersecurity awareness education on policies and methods to all employees
<li>	Maintaining up to date with latest versions of software on networks, devices, and software
<li>Creating a backup of data and information on a constant basis
<li>	Caution of unexpected email links
<li>Avoid downloading from unverified sources (unknown sources)
<li>	Keeping away from using public Wi-Fi connectivity
<li>	Setting all social interaction profiles to private
<li>	Double thinking everything sold online
<li>	Activating privacy settings on social networks
<li>	Monitoring of kid’s activities through parental controls, by limiting access to what kids can view online
<li>	Contacting local authorities if you suffered from any identity theft, child exploitation or commercial scams
Reference: (Raj Singh Deora, 2021)
Even though these methods can help to improve cybersecurity the main concern surrounding it, is that as more devices connect, the harder it is to close the gap for security measures. In saying this, risk management has been a recent methodology adopted by many organisations around the world, in an attempt to close the gap (Kosub, 2015). Reasons for this is that as technology advances so does cybercrime, which in turn requires more cybersecurity efforts in establishing effective protection.</ul></p>
<h2>What is likely to be able to be done soon? (Say in the next 3 years) </h2><p>
Cybersecurity will likely comprise of multiple correcting combinations of fields including, computer science, mathematics, economics, law, psychology, and engineering. In the upcoming years it will not only involve devices connecting through networks, but it will also combine how humans interact and how they are influenced using technological devices, while keeping up with the gap between growing technologies and the skills required to protect users (Dawson J, 2018).
</p>
<h2>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h2><p> <ul>
To make this possible there will have to be massive improvements in the workforce of cybersecurity, and is highly recommended that the workforce should consist of employees that have highly regarded traits, for example,
<li>They must be systemic thinkers, to help explore beyond the physical hardware and attain more of a logical approach, as upgrading system software’s could potentially affect other systems connecting to it.
<li>They must be team players due to the level of difficulty the cyber world has, it is crucial to work in teams as working on ones own will not show an increase of security, where working in a cohesive manner will improve performance on closing the vulnerability in cybersecurity, by identifying threats, breaches, and updates of technology sooner rather then later through a team collaboration.
<li>	The passion for continuous learning is essential to stay up to date with all new technologies and threats, where problem solving is essential (Dawson J, 2018).
</ul></p>
<h2> What is the potential impact of this development?</h2><p>

	Cyber threats today are “almost exclusively used to describe information security matters.” (Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21) . Cyber threats can cause major issues, including having your personal accounts stolen and used against your will. Even if your electronic device was not hacked that does not mean the corporation that you are signed up to won’t be hacked. “Cyber threats are a big deal. Cyber attacks can cause blackouts, failure of military equipment, and breaches in national security secrets” (Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21).  The overall development of cybercrime is very worrisome. Knowing that you should not connect to any internet device that is not your own is not something that everyone abides by. In fact a lot of young people are interested in learning how to hack, and this is what piques their interest in IT. The UK government has developed a game worth $20 million dollars to help encourage young people to learn cyber security so they can bridge the gap between white hat and black hat hackers. ( Davey Winder, 3.9.19)
</p>
<h2>What is likely to change? </h2> <p>
	Cyber threats never stay the same, they are always evolving into something bigger and more potent. There are even some security threats right now that do not carry a detectable digital signature ( Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21). The best practice for defending against a cyber security threat is as simple as patching systems. A company will issue updates to their systems due to the fact they have found an exploit and need to fix it. Educating people on why it is important to do these updates is also an excellent step in helping reduce the number of personal hacks that can occur.
</p>
<h2>Which people will be most affected and how? </h2><p>

	47 percent of Americans experienced financial identity theft in 2020. These losses amounted to $712.4 Billion dollars in 2020 (Insurance Information Institute). Statistics referred to by the Insurance Information Institute state that “The highest percentage of consumers who were victimized in 2020 were between 35 and 44 years of age and accounted for 30 percent of all identity theft victims”. That is roughly 213 billion dollars for that age category. That age bracket is definitely not what we were expecting as a large component of identity theft victims. The implications of this age bracket is only going to get worse as they get older due to the more potent hacks that people are coming up with today. “One cyber security company estimates that global cybercrime cost will grow by 15% per over the next five years, reaching US$10.5 Trillion annually by 2025, which is up from US$3T in 2015 ( Australian Institute of Criminology, 07/21)”. That is a staggering amount of money.</p>
<h2>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h2> <p>
	This will definitely create jobs. In Australia alone we offer courses under FREE-TAFE which is a tafe that is paid for by the government for you and you do not need to pay them back. One of these that is heavily pushed is Cyber Security. “Few industries are growing as fast as the cyber security industry”(ECU, 02.03.21). If anything cyber security will force people to innovate and create to stop people from stealing personal information.
</p>

<h2>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h2>

	<p>Cyber Crime already affects me. I currently have a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> on the way which will help act as two factor authentication for my personal devices. It will have NFC functionality and USB connectivity. The reason I have chosen to get one of these is because when I was much younger, I fell victim to cyber crime. This was only in a game, so it did not affect me at all, however it did cause me to always have a code generating authentication key from then forward. In my daily life it will be annoying at times to have such a functionality, however it is short term pain to adjust to using more than just a password to keep files and personal data safe.</p>


<h2>What will be different for you?  </h2><p>

Overall cyber crime changes how I view everything and anything I do online. I will always be more vigilant in what I put online. I already do not like the use of social media, nor do I like the apps they put out to send messages to friends, family and acquaintances. </p>
<h2>How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h2><p>
	Cyber crime has already affected friends and family members. Instructing them to contact people via an encrypted messaging service such as <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, they find it a nuisance and simply do not want to go to the effort. Or they believe we are being “silly”. Cyber crime is a serious thing, especially in today’s technological age. People will only take you seriously once it has happened to them and they have a mistake to learn from. </p>
