<h1>Robots</h1>

<p>All known life has its range of physical and chemical limits, such temperature, physical space, temperature, water, pH, and the availability of energy (Takai K. 2019). Even as human beings have evolved to become the dominant species on earth, we find ourselves limited by our bodies. We have become the dominant species through our brains, and its need for exploration, improvement, and understanding. By manipulating our ecosystem through trial and error over countless generations we find ourselves being able to be able to leave our planet. We are also inventing new machines, robots. The technology of robots is robotics. As defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica “Robot, any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. By extension, robotics is the engineering discipline dealing with the design, construction, and operation of robots.” (Moravec. P 2021) Robotics is an extremely broad field with engineers from computer science, programming, information processing, electrical, mechanical, and mechatronic contributing.
</p>

<p>The possibilities of robots are documented in our literary and visual arts culture, while mostly fiction it is from similar creative minds that our contemporary robots came from. Most of the robots in existence are for industrial use, the speed, reliability, and accuracy of the work performed exceeds most humans on every level even before considering the lower production costs as they do not require wages. Robots need only electricity and protection, either engineered into it or provided. The usefulness of a model all comes down to its engineering and that is decided by its purpose. With few environmental factors not being able to be overcome through robotics, dangerous tasks for living organisms can be performed from exploring mars to disabling bombs. Robots are essentially just an extension of ourselves, a product of our minds, another tool that is as useful or destructive as who controls it.
Robots are most closely associated with manufacturing as repetition is part of an assembly line production. Potkonjak, Veljko, Spyros Tzafestas, and Kostic state that tasks are geared towards the outcome with jobs specified and the robot’s proper kinematics defined, though all dependent on the technology applied. Some industries are utilising aspects of artificial intelligence with robots equipped with senses such as vision and touch and the ability to make simple decisions, with research aimed at providing a degree of self sufficiency in an unstructured environment (2000).</p>

<p>Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision making in an unstructured situation (Britannica, 2021).The rise in the number robots can be attributed to the surge of computer technology robots are simply an extension of a computer enabling it to interact with the environment. The invention the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) Electronics forum (2021) and the silicon chip, has enabled computer systems to become smaller while also becoming more powerful has also added robotics with better hardware.

<p>Their rapid evolution is providing new opportunities for scientists and engineers to break barriers that are beyond human beings (Cottingham, M., Garrod, B. and George, D. 2017). In some parts of the world (particularly Japan) robots are applied to much more than just industry. The Japanese culture has embraced robots loke nowhere else with genuine affection being expressed for them by many. Emotional support is one area that robots are being employed, with gestures and body language programmed enabling communication with people on an emotional level. (Cottingham. Et al. 2017). With a declining birth rate in Japan many roles may be taken by robots in the future however in many parts of the world their roles are less clear. (Keisner, A., Raffo, J., & Wunsch-Vincent, S. 2016) found that the recent advances in artificial intelligence and robots while capable of providing growth, may also affect the socio-economic balance of our society.</p>
<p>Just as the car replaced the horse and the industrial revolution caused a mass migration to cities to work in factories, robots may also completely change our lives and what we do with them. More than just a philosophical quandary the impact of dehumanisation is evident with the military application of drones and the operator using a system that resembles a computer game. The people most affected in a negative way are likely to be the least affluent and those without any voice, political or otherwise. The outcomes of nations and individuals alike is defined by adaption, when a paradigm shift occurs it is important to figure out what is coming with you and what is being left behind.</P>
<p>The future of robots appears to link with AI, at that point they would become androids. Intelligence itself is difficult to define, instincts and imagination seem to me to as important as doing something correctly. Alan Turing suggested any evidence of original thought can be put down as it was still the work of a programmer (Britannica,2020). Perhaps the intelligence could be found through evolution and on the programmes own terms, maybe it wouldn’t resemble anything we have ever encountered.</p>
<p>Personally, I would love to see androids and robots become more prevalent. At some point we should all be able to live rich fulfilling lives doing what we want to do. It might take a while, but I don’t believe someone working on an assembly line is reaching their full potential. My family was most happy when they owned their own business, while the stress was higher, and it could be extremely challenging they controlled their destiny. Computers and robots could enable many people to become their own bosses and many new markets and products, and opportunities may become available. In the future we may form a symbiotic relationship and come to regard one another as equals.</p>
