    <p><li><strong>Name:</strong>Lachlan Jensen</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> S3922643</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> Nu RecruITs</li><li><strong>About Lachlan:</strong></li>My name is Lachlan Jensen, and I am part of the nuRecruITs team. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria. Throughout my childhood, my family travelled a lot due to my father’s occupation. This led to me completing the majority of my schooling outside of Australia, in countries such as Switzerland, Malaysia and the United States. During this time abroad it allowed me to experience many different cultures and meet some extremely interesting people. I think that this experience helps me relate to a wide range of people and has helped me get the most out of life. My favourite hobbies are Music, PC gaming and Anime/Manga. I learnt the Guitar and Piano from an early age from my grandmother and I have been playing since then. Music is a huge part of my life, and I couldn’t imagine spending a whole day away from my guitar. I first became interested in IT from playing computer games at an early age and have recently begun to formalise my knowledge by completing my Diploma in Information Technology Networking, I am now studying at RMIT to get a degree and to continue to build my skills.</p>

    <p>I believe that these results show that I can be a very effective member of a team, I can learn in a mixed variety of styles, and I have a very good work ethic, I am an easy person to talk to and if I see someone struggling, I feel obliged to help. I work very well in a team however I work most effectively when directed by a leader figure, with clear goals and direction. The aspect I have to work on is my emotional stability and stress management, in a team this is extremely important and can be the deciding factor between a successful team and dysfunctional one. </p>

My favourite hobbies include, spending time with family, camping, fishing, designing my own MS Excel budgeting platform and watching YouTube. I have no current experience in IT, though my interest in IT grew out of self-learning and to seek a change in my career from working in a warehouse, then to achieve my goal of getting my job of interest in Cyber Security.</p>

  <p>Even though I am happy being seen as an assertive protagonist, these results show some areas that I could work on with some development gained through experience, such as my nature, energy, and tactics. I could show more of a focus on the thinking side and less on the feeling side when it comes to my nature, my energy needs to have more of a spontaneous approach and my tactics should be less judging and promote a more of an inviting approach. Given my current results I feel this could impact my team’s behaviour in a negative way and I will work towards developing these skills and experiences, to help with my efforts in team cooperation and progression, not only showing benefits as an individual, but also advancing my team’s morals in achieving main goals.</p>
