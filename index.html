      A bit more of background on myself is, I played sport from the age of seven to eight years old. Until I was seventeen years old. I played basketball as a point guard and I played almost everyday of the week, most weekends I would play between three to four games all at separate stadiums as well as train and play more games during the week. I would be a leader on the court, running team plays, giving other players confidence to take an opportunity when they are open for it. I was known for my defensive skills, ball control, ability to read and run a play. I would call out our defense strategy on the court in real time, back myself and the team in. I learned to be a referee of the sport as well. I would always play right on the edge sometimes being fouled out. I would play aggressive but fair, with mind games involved as a separate aspect of game to get in my opponents heads.

    <p> What do these results mean to me?</p>
      <ul>
        <div id="listadjust">
          <li>To be honest I think they hit the marker bang on in some areas such as logical thinking, in a way such as I will always think about the issue at hand and not just try to solve the issue but stop the issue from reoccurring. In forming a team and my behavior towards a team I think my current method is okay. I am okay with being myself and everyone being their selves. I am happy to take in what people are saying and will speak up when needed. When I was a manager in retail I would do exactly this except I would listen to what my team members would have to say and then judge by the most logical outcome.</li>

I was born in Melbourne, Victoria. Throughout my childhood, my family travelled a lot due to my father’s occupation. This led to me completing the majority of my schooling outside of Australia, in countries such as Switzerland, Malaysia and the United States. During this time abroad it allowed me to experience many different cultures and meet some extremely interesting people. I think that this experience helps me relate to a wide range of people and has helped me get the most out of life. My favourite hobbies are Music, PC gaming and Anime/Manga. I learnt the Guitar and Piano from an early age from my grandmother and I have been playing since then. Music is a huge part of my life, and I couldn’t imagine spending a whole day away from my guitar. I first became interested in IT from playing computer games at an early age and have recently begun to formalise my knowledge by completing my Diploma in Information Technology Networking, I am now studying at RMIT to get a degree and to continue to build my skills.

    <p>I believe that these results show that I can be a very effective member of a team, I can learn in a mixed variety of styles, and I have a very good work ethic, I am an easy person to talk to and if I see someone struggling, I feel obliged to help. I work very well in a team however I work most effectively when directed by a leader figure, with clear goals and direction. The aspect I have to work on is my emotional stability and stress management, in a team this is extremely important and can be the deciding factor between a successful team and dysfunctional one. </p>

    <p>

I am Sydney born and raised, but ten years ago, when I had young children, I decided to move out of the city for the space and fresh air promised by the beautiful Southern Highlands, two hours south-west of Sydney.

I studied a Bachelor of Science straight after high school, focusing on human biology. I did not have a lot of career direction and stumbled into a job as a professional firefighter. While this is an exciting career, it is not mentally stimulating and I have started to stagnate and worry about my future, especially as my body gets older and more fragile.

I think everyone found 2020 to be a strange and challenging year. For me it was always going to be life changing, even before the historic events unfolded. My eldest child turned 10, my youngest child started primary school and my partner returned to full time work. I was excited at the possibilities this year was to create, and had a long list of hobbies, projects and ideas to throw myself into. I enrolled in an online Introduction to Computer Science course, and was instantly hooked. To be learning again after 15 years was refreshing, especially something as powerful and modern as computer programming. I felt a rush of excitement when I understood a piece of coding and was able to solve a problem. But four weeks in, the first lockdown hit, and I was thrown into homeschooling three primary school children, including a kindergarten child in term 1! What followed was an exhausting and brain-breaking few months, and by the end my energy and drive for the year was depleted.

I am enthusiastic about all things Italian - the food, the culture, the landscape, the history. I studied a little of the language when I was a teenager and it came quite naturally. A few years ago I picked it up again, in the hope that I might escape there for six months when I turn 40. I was getting pretty good, utilising a couple of language apps, and then the pandemic hit. It's pretty hard to stay motivated when there is no prospect of international travel on the horizon. I think I will be past 40 by the time I am next on an aeroplane. So this year I am turning my language-learning towards something a little more universal, and a little more lockdown-friendly. I am learning two languages - Python and HTML!</p>

My favourite hobbies include, spending time with family, camping, fishing, designing my own MS Excel budgeting platform and watching YouTube.

    <p>Even though I am happy being seen as an assertive protagonist, these results show some areas that I could work on with some development gained through experience, such as my nature, energy, and tactics. I could show more of a focus on the thinking side and less on the feeling side when it comes to my nature, my energy needs to have more of a spontaneous approach and my tactics should be less judging and promote a more of an inviting approach. Given my current results I feel this could impact my team’s behaviour in a negative way and I will work towards developing these skills and experiences, to help with my efforts in team cooperation and progression, not only showing benefits as an individual, but also advancing my team’s morals in achieving main goals.</p>
