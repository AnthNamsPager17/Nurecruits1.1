      <h1>Single Board Computers</h1>
<h2>What are single board computers?</h2>
<p>Single board computers (SBC’s) are complete computers built on a single circuit board. They operate through the use of:<br> •	A computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated Circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits, known as a microprocessor.
•	A random-access Memory device (RAM) that allows data to be read and changed in any necessary order. The random-access memory is used to hold working data and machine code necessary for the use of the SBC.
•	A system for communication between operating systems, the computer and the external world, be it a human or another processing system, referred to as Input/output (io’s or IO’s).</p>
<p>The most common use of a single board computer is in the use of embedded applications. an embedded computer refers to a device whose capabilities are restricted to the requirements of the task for which it has been designed. Unlike other apps and tools, it cannot be further expanded to contain other capabilities, this is what makes SBC’s the most appropriate tool for some jobs as SBC’s work without the need of expansion slots to perform peripheral tasks and expansions. SBC’s applications expand out to home computers, portable devises, typically gaming (slot machines and video poker), kiosks, and machine control automation.</p>
<p>SBC’s are cheap and easily produced their light weight and compact size enables speedy shipping. Compared to laptops and personal computers SBC’s simplicity increases reliability and power efficiency.</p>
<p>Single Board Computers date back to 1976, (The first true single-board computer made an appearance in the May 1976 issue of Radio-Electronics), it was named "dyna-micro". However, they gained a large increase in notability after the invention of the raspberry pi.</p>
<h2>What is a Raspberry Pi?</h2>
 <p>The Raspberry pi is an SBC created for educational purposes, it is a handheld device (often compared to the size of a credit card) with the intended use of tutoring programming languages like scratch and python, whilst still replicating the abilities of a desktop computer. It soon became the most Popular SBC after its release in 2013, in thanks to its low cost, ordered rows general of purpose input/output pins (GPIO’s) that allow it to interact with keyboards, mouse, computer monitors and other devices. The commonality of these devices also makes them very appealing to the inexperienced and experiences alike in the fields of programming and computing
The field of SBCs is ever expanding, but the Raspberry pi has proven itself to be the head of the spear when it comes to SBCs, as the most sold and supported tool available. The Raspberry pi is what most would consider the state of the art SBC for 2021, and is used to teach Children computer science in schools internationally as well as other peoples in low-income countries
the Raspberry Pi’s ability to interact with the outside world can be used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines, weather stations and basic robotics.</p>
<h2>what is the potential impact of this development?</h2>
<P>Larger quantities of new technology having greater computing capacity.
With the increased sales distribution of SBCs like the raspberry pi, and their improvements, we could see the highest level of computer & coding literacy seen ever. With systems specifically built to introduce children into programming, we could experience entire year groups leaving high school with an understanding of program that would have taken years to acquire beforehand. These devices also make it easier to teach people to learn coding in low-income countries, and how coding can be used to solve problems  this could lead to new industries and opportunities.</p>
<h2>What is likely to change?</h2>
<p>Any machine or tool that uses an SBC will have an increased capacity for directions. And machines that previously needed larger computers to operate will be able to act independently from a larger console, due to having the computer device stored within the machine itself</p>
<h2>Which people will be most affected and how?</h2>
<p>The people most affected by any improvements would be students, professionals in IT and programming, computer specialists and those who work with robotics and machinery. Due to the nature of interaction these groups have with SBCs naturally, any improvements to the technology would see further expanse in these fields.</p>
<h2>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h2>
<p>Though new Machinery is inching itself into the workforce every day, the improvement of SBCs would not itself increase the redundancy of other jobs in the workplace. It could however produce an influx of programmers into the workplace with their ability to quickly identify problems and program SBCs could enable many businesses to use innovative technologies like robots to improve their outcomes. As these programmers learnt with SBC’s they could in the future be the preferred tool used by most. It could also see the replacement of full computers in environments where they would be too expensive to procure on mass or to large to use and store reasonably, whether externally or internally in the necessary machine.</p>
<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
<p>You may not realise but more and more items are using SBC’s every year, and with it an increase in demand in education, SBCs may become every day use items for millions of people across the world, you may find the most machinery in your kitchen one day to hold these devices, take for example modern high-end refrigerators that can keep track of ingredients in the fridge and add them to shopping lists and notices automatically, with improvements in SBCs we could also see microwaves that could communicate with your phone to notify you of when they were completed, track the time the food has remained in the microwave for in total, or communicate with inbuilt home systems to safely turn of in the case of an emergency like a house-fire.</p>
<h2>What will be different for you?</p>
<p>Truly the most impressive thing about the upgrade and implementation of SBCs is how they would not affect most people directly, their improvement would see the technology we use in our everyday life improve, without forcing most people to change their lifestyles in any major way. The option to explore the use of SBCs for educational purposes, for example, would increase for the average joe, but would remain an option and not a necessity in modern life.</p>
<h2> How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h2>
<p>The impact that these advancements have is going to be felt throughout most interactions we would have most machines we would interact with on a day-to-day basis. Your friends and family would not even know they were using tech that relied on SBC’s. they would continue to use and interact with SBCs on a day-to-day basis, but the technology would be higher functioning, quicker and be capable of interacting with more components in the machine than ever before. More interestingly is with the increased use of SBCs as education tools, your friends and family may end up encountering Raspberry pi’s and other SBCs in the workplace and educational environments like Primary schools and high schools directly, hands on, not just behind a machine wall.</p>
