  <h1>IT Project</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2> <p>
  We envisage a future where networked drones control the airspace just out of earshot, making our lives effortlessly more efficient and easier, while saving our Earth from the deleterious effects of our century-long addiction to road travel and transport.
</p> <p>Visions need a first step, a crack, that opens the door to generational change and progress. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us that in the face of fear, humans will always strive for an opportunity to save lives. A technological step to achieving even better chances to save a life is in drone technology. Drones capable of responding to distress calls from humans requiring medical attention will be much faster than currently possible, by providing earlier and better care in the first critical minutes of a life-threatening emergency.
  </p> <p>The drones can be instantly activated, responding to events that are triggered by a user who is using a smartphone app.  The drone will then travel swiftly to the GPS coordinates of the emergency. Final descent and the clinical management of the emergency will be conducted by a medical flight controller. The drone will deliver lifesaving equipment. This equipment could be a defibrillator, oxygen tank, epi-Pens or a first aid kit. Our drones will also have the functionality to be used in a delivery infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>As a group we collectively enjoyed the fact that we will start to learn about drones and how to program them together. We all enjoy the aspect of saving lives and believe that this is an excellent opportunity to develop and learn about how drones will be capable of doing this. From that standpoint it is also knowledgeable not to just learn to develop a drone with the aim of saving lives but, also making lives easier with delivery options available. In today's society due to the ongoing effects of Covid-19 we are at a point where we need to maintain a high level of sanitary standards. By being capable of doing drone deliveries we are not only doing our part in Australia for staying at home but we are able to reduce the spread of Covid-19 with a drone delivery, instead of the human to human interaction, we have a drone doing it for us.

  </p> <p>
Road networks suffocate large portions of the surface of the earth (Watts 2019), and the greenhouse gases of fossil-fuelled vehicles are poisoning our planet (Henriques-Gomez, 2018). The world is headed in the direction where all travel and transport is conducted using autonomous and self-driving vehicles fuelled by green power sources. A relatively simple step in breaking our reliance on road travel is showcasing the benefits of artificial intelligence and alternative transport modes in the idea of Resuscitation Drones.

  </p> <p>Heart attack, or myocardial infarction, is when blood flow to the heart is blocked by a blood clot or build-up of arterial plaque (Heart Foundation). Heart attack claims the lives of 21 Australians per day (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018). Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem where the heart stops beating. When this occurs, blood is not circulating and all cells in the body, including the brain and vital organs, are deprived of oxygen (Heart Foundation). A cardiac arrest is a medical emergency where the patient will be unconscious and not breathing. 70% of cardiac arrests are caused by heart attacks (Better Health Channel), which commonly occur in a person's home, but can occur anywhere in the community (Heart Foundation). Every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest decreases the chance of survival (NSW Health). Approximately 25,000 Australians suffer a cardiac arrest each year, with only around 5% of these surviving long term (Heart Foundation).
  </p> <p> Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency where the patient will be unconscious and not breathing. 70% of cardiac arrests are caused by heart attacks (Better Health Channel), which commonly occur in a person's home, but can occur anywhere in the community (Heart Foundation). Every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest decreases the chance of survival (NSW Health). Approximately 25,000 Australians suffer a cardiac arrest each year, with only around 5% of these surviving long term (Heart Foundation).
</p> <p>  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation and oxygen therapy are first aid therapies shown to improve survival rates after cardiac arrest to over 60% (National Centre for Biotechnology Information). With each minute of delayed access to defibrillation, survival chances drop 7 to 10% (National Centre for Biotechnology Information). If defibrillation was to be made available by drones minutes earlier than currently possible, this survival rate will be further improved, including increased quality of life for survivors. A defibrillator requires no training to be used, as they are automatic and have clear voice prompts (Health Direct).
  </p> <p>Currently, a defibrillator is used prior to ambulance arrival in only 3% of cardiac arrest cases (NSW Ambulance, 2019). Cardiac arrests are given a priority 1A designation by NSW Ambulance, allowing use of lights and sirens and multiple units dispatched to ensure minimum response time. The median response time by NSW Ambulance to these calls is 8 minutes in Sydney, and 9 minutes in Regional NSW (NSW Ambulance, 2018).  This is on top of the time it takes to call 000 and speak to the operator. This information is tightly guarded, but there are indications to be found. Ambulance Victoria answered 93% of calls within 5 seconds, and responded an ambulance to 85% of code 1 (which includes cardiac arrest) events within 150 seconds (ESTA Annual Report 2019-20). If we combine these figures, then 9 minutes is about the earliest you can expect to have an ambulance arrive at your doorstep once you call 000. 11 or 12 minutes is more likely, and after this point we know that you have a close to 0% chance of survival.
  </p> <p>Drones can fly at speeds of up to 200km/h (Drone Rush), they do not have to follow road networks, negotiate traffic, deal with corners or hills, and can travel "as the crow flies". Our proposal would have a Resuscitation Drone based in every town/suburban centre, making most citizens within 5-10km of a drone. Including the time taken to ascend and descend we predict this would allow a defibrillator to arrive on scene at a cardiac arrest 2-4 minutes after an emergency signal has been sent via the app. </p> <p>Further time benefits are achieved in the speed of processing the incident location using an instantaneous mobile phone application, as opposed to traditional 000 methods that require conversing with multiple human operators, knowing your location, and communicating the information articulately during a time of great distress. Even if a drone is sent out and it is determined that the person does not need the equipment we still predict that the drone can effect change and help save lives.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A heavy-duty drone, or quadcopter, that is based in a secure location in each town centre across Australia. This drone is equipped with an automatic external defibrillator (AED), B size medical oxygen cylinder (170L), various size oropharyngeal airways, various size resuscitation masks, epi-pen and first aid equipment.
</p>
<p>
  The great advantage of this project idea is that it brings life-saving technology to parts of our world where this technology is currently absent, and where it is desperately needed. Defibrillators are currently found in major urban hubs, so if you have a heart attack near a supermarket or shopping centre, you have a greater chance of access to early defibrillation and survival. However, most heart attacks occur in people's homes or workplaces, as this is where we spend most of our time (Heart Foundation). Almost all homes, and the majority of workplaces, do not have access to defibrillation. But with Resuscitation Drones these spaces are opened up for rapid delivery of this life-saving technology.
</p>
<p>
  Access is a concern that could be circumvented with the application of some tools for breaking into a home. This would raise privacy concerns among citizens so would require thorough ethical analysis. Remote controlled glass-breaking would be the most obvious, fastest and least destructive method of entry into a home. Lock-picking or lock destruction could be another avenue, however the more hardware required for the drone, the heavier and more expensive it becomes.
</P>
<p>
  Currently the idea relies on a bystander calling for the drone after witnessing the patient's declining health and recognising the need. An aspect that we could investigate for Assignment 3 is wearable technology that could detect signs in the patient and automatically call for a drone as required. A patient alone at home presents the problem of access to the home, as well as the application of the defibrillator.
</P>
<p>
  The ability to bring life saving technology to remote areas of the country, or areas with difficult access, is also a benefit. There are many areas of Australia that are sparsely populated, where access to emergency medical treatment is untimely. There are also areas of bushland close to urban centres that are accessible only along difficult, unsealed roads, where an ambulance would take considerable time to respond due to gradient and road surface constraints, but where a drone can cover the same distance speedily and effortlessly in the air. Consider also Australians love of the outdoors and enjoying remote locations, from bushwalking to camping to finding hidden beaches or fishing spots. A medical emergency in these locations is often an emergency of access just as much as it is of health. A drone that deliver equipment to these locations, and possibly even administer some procedures, will undoubtedly save lives.
</p>
   <p>All smartphones come pre-installed with a Resuscitation Drone app or function. This is activated by TouchID or FaceID, confirms requirement for resuscitation, and activates the drone to respond to the GPS coordinates of the phone. The drone is assigned an altitude and flight path by artificial intelligence at the inception of its mission, allowing for clear air space between its base and the incident. At arrival of the incident it will automatically descend to within 30m, at which point a flight controller will take command of the drone, navigating it directly to the household front door or nearest outdoor location utilising cameras on the drone.

  </p> <p>During the short response time the flight controller can be talking through the app to the bystander who activated the drone, advising on the progress of the drone, what to expect when it arrives, and how to prepare the patient. Concurrently, an ambulance is alerted and responded, ensuring that both professional medical staff arrive on scene as early as possible, but that defibrillation is available in the minutes prior to their arrival, ensuring the best possible outcome for the patient. The flight controller can observe the patient for the obvious presentation of cardiac arrest (Paramedic Study Guide) and direct the bystander on how to set up the defibrillator and oxygen equipment.
  </p>
<p>
  It is possible that the defibrillator could be redesigned so that it does not require a human to apply it. Certainly an advantage of the drone is that because it hovers midair it is not earthed and so can deliver an electric shock itself, whereas a human must stand clear after activating a defibrillator.
</p>
<p>
We plan to program our drone in a team structure via Python programming language. We have already experimented writing a prototype program in Python that could assign an appropriate altitude to an activated drone, given other drones in the area (see appendix). We will work on developing a Python program for path planning and collaborate our code via a GitHub repository.
</p>
   <p>Early models will prioritise defibrillation, but as the technology develops, we could have developed robotic arms that can provide chest compressions. Chest compressions are very difficult to perform, must be the correct depth of chest and rhythm, and are physically exhausting as well as intimidating for a bystander. A mechanical and automatic chest compressor attached to the drone could provide perfect compressions without tiring, and in perfect synchronisation with the AED and oxygen equipment.
  </p> <p>Current drones can easily carry 10kg of weight, that is easily enough for an uber style delivery of soft goods or food, with much greater capacity for specially designed drones (Drone Enthusiast). A defibrillator weighs approximately 2.5kg (AEDS) and an oxygen cylinder weighs approximately 2.5kg (Wiley). Oxygen delivery equipment is made of very lightweight plastic, so the combined weight of equipment carried will be under 10kg.
    <p>
      Marketing is an important step in being able to produce our drone. We would like nurecruIT’s to be a non-for-profit company that can develop the drone and its functions in a way to help save lives. Having support from the state or federal government would allow us to use the drones in areas that are currently restricted or not allowed. You currently cannot just fly a drone in a suburban street because of drone laws. For our device to work to its full effectiveness we will need support from all governments to fly the drones in these otherwise restricted areas. To market our product, we plan to produce a prototype with a video showing how it can saves lives by delivering a drone to a location before an ambulance can get to the emergency. In the video it will simply show how far a drone can travel in the time you unlock your phone and start being able to communicate your emergency to a phone operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      A phone with a pre-installed app that will also dial triple zero is an ideal scenario for how we would roll out the final version of what we have developed. However, not everyone will be happy about having something pre-installed on their smart device, because of this we will develop in accordance with smart-phone manufacturers and Australia’s telecommunication service providers that when you dial triple-zero in Australia it will also prompt you to a webpage to deploy the drone to your location. Simultaneously, once you have dialled triple zero the operator that is talking to you on the phone will be able to access the drone’s cameras, this will allow the emergency operator to help each individual caller in a way that is even more refined and specified to each call they receive.
    </p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2> <p> <ul>
  <li>Artificial intelligence for organising discrete flight paths, tracking drones and incident locations, avoiding collisions, and ensuring no coverage gaps by moving standby drones into position. The ability to select altitude and calculate flight path based on base location, destination and other aircraft/drones/obstacles on the route
  <li>High definition digital maps, for accurate geo positioning (Infosys 2020)
  <li>Fast drones capable of carrying approx 10kg of weight
  <li>Small public spaces to build drone hangars that house docking stations, solar panels, batteries, computer hardware and communications equipment. Rooftops could be a good option
  <li>Implementing AI to abide by drone laws and regulations of residing country or state.
  <li>There will be a fee to purchase a drone, to get a good drone to program it can cost roughly $200 AUD.
  </ul> </p> <p>Software solutions, including open source (px4), for navigating autonomous drones exist and are constantly improving. Communication software exists for contacting and updating autonomous drones and communicating with bases and has demonstrated success in challenging communication settings since 2009 (Mavlink). High definition digital maps provide much greater usability for autonomous vehicles, and are currently in development, with expected completion by 2025 (Infosys 2020).
</p>
<p>
  We will investigate geofencing technology similar to that used in Canberra e-scooter rentals (Bladen, 2020). In Canberra this is used to disable scooters near waterways to prevent vandalism, and also to enforce slow speed zones in high traffic areas. We envisage using the same technology to ensure drones do not enter restricted airspace, such as near airfields and hospital helipads. This geofencing would need to be built into the drone path planning as well as the software that monitors the drone network. The closest available drone is not always the best to activate, for instance if there is a medical emergency near the airport, the software must be clever enough to choose the drone that is 4km away, rather than the drone that is 2.5km away but has to fly through the restricted airspace.
</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2> <p> <ul>
  <li>	Cross platform app development - must be available on iOS, Android and Windows phones
  <li>	User interface design - must be clean, simple, easy to use, and fast
  <li>Programming languages for mobile app development such as C# and Javascript (Redbytes), as well as web development languages HTML and CSS (Toth, 2017)
  <li>	Programming languages such as C++, Swift and Python for autonomous drone navigation (Drone Code)
  <li>	Data skills - build databases to monitor and tweak drone network performance
  <li>Cyber security to protect user data and drone network from being sabotaged - mistake or accident would be a public relations disaster that could kill the project
  <li>	Knowledge and understanding of the Internet of Things - software could be linked to other devices around the home, not just mobile phones, to increase accessibility
  </ul></p> <p>This project is highly feasible. Fast drones and heavy lift drones already exist. Engineers could easily build a drone to specifications. A small surcharge could be added to the purchase of any new phone to account for the cost.
  </p> <p>The software skills and products required already exist independently, and require only an amalgamation and integration within this project. Drones can currently travel independently of a pilot when given parameters of a journey by a human operator(Koetsier, 2021). It is feasible to believe that these parameters can now come from the app and the known location of the nearest drone, bypassing the need for human input of these parameters. These drones navigate using sensors and are currently able to explore and map underground mines and search a smoke-logged building for occupants (Koetsier, 2021). These drones are not fast, used mostly for slow inspection purposes, but given that Resuscitation Drones and delivery drones will fly at a clear altitude, obstacle avoidance is not a requirement, so engineering for maximum speed and capable to stand all weathers will be a primary focus.
</p>
<p>We plan to program our drone in a team structure via Python programming language. We have already experimented writing a <a href="images/python_altitude_program.pdf" target="blank">prototype program</a> in Python that could assign an appropriate altitude to an activated drone, given other drones in the area. We will work on developing a Python program for path planning and collaborate our code via a GitHub repository. </p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>If this project is successful there will be significantly improved outcomes for sufferers of sudden cardiac arrest, a medical emergency with a high mortality rate that can affect anyone, any time. It will also help reduce the spread of Covid-19 via having more items delivered by a drone. People would feel safer knowing they are protected by this technology. For instance Paramedics will arrive on scene to a life that is being preserved and is saveable, instead of the current situation where too much time has passed when the ambulance arrives and outcomes are poor.
  </p> <p>This project will show industry, politicians and society of the benefits and feasibility of drone technology, and in artificial intelligence to deliver improvements to human life. This can help lead to a further extension of this technology to other emergency and non-emergency services. Time is critical in fire and police emergencies and the ability to swiftly or silently arrive at an incident and conduct some initial actions to avoid escalation can circumvent the incident from progressing into something more serious.
  </p> <p>Beyond this scope entrepreneurs could find numerous more commercial applications for this technology, the speedy delivery of goods with minimum human labour and greenhouse emissions being explored even further.
  </p> <p>Overall, we hope to achieve a proof of concept by programming a drone to a pre-determined path, by using GPS co-ordinates. The drone will be able to navigate all terrain on the path we set, a more in-depth proof of concept will be by mapping a small area I.E a park that stretches by more than 300m in length.  We hope to be able to market a product in such a way that we can receive funding to progress further. Progressing even further down the line we wish to develop our own in-house app that will co-ordinate with the drone.
